2.Why we need an IP address and mac address?

each computer has mac and ip address assigned to it

ip address are routable

not every computer can send to multiple group of people 
but one which does this is called as the router

routers rote message between different group of computers

mac address are physical and are not routable

mac address handles the physical connection between the
computers 

ip address handles the logical routable connection between computer
to computers and network to networks

mac/physical address is a gloabaly the unique id for your device

mac address is efficent for the local communication.

if the hardware is lost the mack address is lossed.

ip address saw where  you are

mac address tells who you are

ip address is flexible and changable.

3.	Are JS and Java are the same?

javascript is a light weigted programming language 
used to make the web page interactive.

where as the java is object orented language used to 
create the applicatoin and run in a virtual machine or 
browser.

though the name are similar they are used for the marketing purpose.

*******************************************************
4.	What are the various Layout and JS engines?

java script engine:

chrome : v8
firefox : spidermonkey
safari: javascriptcore
edge :chakra

v8 is written in c++

v8 convers the javascript code into optimized machine code

v8 thread has four threads

main thread   fetch->compile->execute

compiler tread  Full-codegen  crankshaft

profiiler thread  monitors code and finds out hot section (ie iterating elements and the recursive elements)

gc thread  garbage collection

full-codegen is creates the machine level code

crankshaft is used for optimization 

the job of the browser engine is :

1. prosses the HTML markup and build the DOM tree.
2.Process CSS markup and build theCSSOM tree
3.combine te Dom and CSSOM into a render tree.
4.rum layout on the render treeto compute geometry of each node.
5.paint the individual nodes to the screen

diffrent brower engines are:

for chrome and opera it is blink
internet explorer trident
mozillafierfox it is gecko 
safare wedkit

5.	What's a programming paradigm?

 it is a method to solve problem or do some task

to implement an programming language we need 
to follow some statergy .this startergy is called as the the 
programming paradigm.

they are devided into two :

1.imperitive programming paradigm

2.Declarative programming paradigm

imperaive programming paradigm:

is devided into 

1.procedural programming paradiigm
2.object orented programming
3.parallel processing approach

it is based on the von neuman architecture

it perfoms setp by step task by changging states

the main focus is on how to achive the goal

this type of paradigm consist of several statements and
after execution of all the result is stored

disadvantage:

complex problem can not be solved

less effective and less productive

prallel programmng is not possible

declarative programming paradigm:

it is sub devided into logic,functional and database

declrative programming is the style of building program that expresses logic of 
computation without taking about its control

focus is on wat neede to be done rather thean how it should
be done

6.	Features of JS?

1. validating uer input
2. simple client side calculaton
3. greaer control
4. platform independent
5. handling date and time 
6. generating HTML content

7.	What happens when you hit a website? Explain the flow in detail.

https://medium.com/@maneesha.wijesinghe1/what-happens-when-you-type-an-url-in-the-browser-and-press-enter-bb0aa2449c1a


when we enter a website name and clik enter

the the browser check the cathe for a dns record to find
the coresponding ip addess for the website

DNS domain name service maintains the website URL and its
coresponding ip address associated with it.

ip address belongs to the computer which host the server of
the website

first it checks the brower cache (browser maintains a repository
of dns record for a fixed duration for website youhave previously
visited.

if not found in the dowser cache the drowser makes the system call
to the undelying os to fech record scienc the OS also
maintains the dns record.

thrid it checks with router cache Router maintains its one 
cach of DNS record

fouth (at last) it checks withe the ISP cache 
ISP has a DNS server which has the set of cache 

if the requeste URL is not found in the cache ,ISP'S
DNS server initiates the DNS Query to find the ip address 
of the sere that host

the pupose of a DNs Query is to suearch multiple DNS servers on the internet util
it finsd the correct IP address of the website.

this type of search is called as the recursive search..

then the browser initiates the tcp connection with the server
when the browser gets the correct ip address

browser use the internet protocolto build connection

tcp is most commenly used for many types of http request

to trasfer data packet for our computer to the sever we need 
to have TCP connection eshtablished.

the process is called as TCP/IP three way handshake

=>

1.client machine sends the SYN (synchronize)packet to the
sever over the internt to ask if it open for new connection

2.if the server has open port that can accept and invite a
new connection it responds with an ACK packet for the SYN 
using SYN/ACK packet.

3. the client will resceice the SYN/ACK packet from the
serve and aknowledge it with the help of ACK packet.

then a TCP connection is established for data transmission.

then the browser send the get request for asking the web page.

the request will have th additional details such as 
browser identification,type of request that it will accept
and connection header asking it to keep the connection open.

serer contains a webserver that receives the request from the
browser and send it to the request handler .

request handler is a programm that read the request ,its heade and
 cookies to check what is being requested and updates the 
information on the server if needed.then it wil assemble a 
response in a particular format

 server response contains the web page, stasus code ,
compression type,how to cache the page ,any cooies to set ,
privacy information etc.

browser first gets the HTML skeliton of the page
following the HTML tags the Browser fetches the css,stylesheet,
javasript files.

************************************************************************
8.	What are the HTTP error codes?
the status code in tht server res[one is a 3 digit integer where the first digit of the
ststus code defines the class of resope and the last two digits do not have any 
categorization 

their are two http error codes

1. which start with 4XX called the client error

it means the request contains incorrect syntax or cannot be fullfiled

example:

400 means bad request

401 means unauthorized

2. which starts with 5XX server error 

it means the server faield to fulfill an apparently vaild request

example

500 internet server error

501 not implemented

11.	What's the default browser method?

Brower method lets us to access a running web browser application 

we can use to access a specific web browser
********************************************************************
HTTP hearder lets the client and the server pass addition information
with an HTTP request or response.

headers can be grouped according to their context like:

general headers

Request headers

respose headers

entity header

end to end header:

these header must be tranmitted to the final recipient of the message.
the sever for a request, or the client for a response.Imtermediate proxies
must etransmit these headers unmodified and cache must store them.


hop by hop header:
these heade are meaningful only for a single transport-level
connection , and most not be retransmitted by proxies or cached.
only hop-by-hop header must be set using the connection general header .

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#:~:text=HTTP%20headers%20let%20the%20client,)%2C%20then%20by%20its%20value.&text=Entity%20headers%20contain%20information%20about,content%20length%20or%20MIME%20type.
