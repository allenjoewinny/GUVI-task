programming paradigm:

https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/#:~:text=A%20programming%20paradigm%20is%20a,thing%20(like%20a%20language).

it is very dynamic in nature and supports various types of programming styles, such as object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming.

Imperative: Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.
Declarative: Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.
Structured: Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.
Procedural: Imperative programming with procedure calls.
Functional (Applicative): Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.
Function-Level (Combinator): Programming with no variables at all.
Object-Oriented: Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other. Objects have their own internal (encapsulated) state and public interfaces. Object orientation can be:
Class-based: Objects get state and behavior based on membership in a class.
Prototype-based: Objects get behavior from a prototype object.
Event-Driven:
